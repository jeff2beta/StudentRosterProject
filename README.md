# University Student Roster System

## Introduction
Welcome to the University Student Roster System project. This project is a C++ application designed to help a university migrate their existing student system to a new platform using C++. The application will read, manipulate, and display student data based on predefined requirements. 

## Project Overview
As a contractor, I have been tasked with implementing a part of the university's student system. The project involves creating two classes: `Student` and `Roster`. The `Student` class will represent individual students, while the `Roster` class will manage a collection of students.
